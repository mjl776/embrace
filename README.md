emBrace is nationwide competition intended to encourage artists to design fashionable prints and patterns for scoliosis braces that appeal to everyone. emBrace honors aesthetically powerful graphic designs by artists across the country and partners with orthopedic companies to transfer them onto the surface of back braces. This year, emBrace is working with Friddles Orthopedic Company to launch the winning designs in their new brace collection.
